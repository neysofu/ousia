# HACKING

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually
  the master branch, which is stable. Watch out for other feature branches,
  which might be unstable.
* Write good, short, descriptive commit titles using the imperative tone. Ex.:

    Fix #42
    Remove dir/file
    Add unit tests for feature xyz
    Fix a typo in README.md

* Avoid trailing whitespace.
* Write tests (!!!)
* Run all the tests to ensure than you didn't break anything.
* Write some documentation if you feel like to. We won't judge you.
* Add your name to AUTHORS.txt with your email/handle and the feature you've
  been working on. Please, keep the list alphabetically sorted.
