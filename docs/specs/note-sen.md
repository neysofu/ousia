# Note
While designing the language, this idea should always be applied: **Always tell
first the most important thing.** This means that modifiers should always come
after their arguments. For example, when designing an API for units, you should
be able to say

    centimetre
    long_ton
    short_ton

This feels better than, say, `long_ton` or `millimetre`. Although these are more
similar to the natural language, they pose emphasis on what's unimportant.

Developers should be able to say when and how to use attributes or top-level
functions, and they should do so by distinct language constructs.
